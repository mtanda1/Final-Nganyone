:star:

## Repo contains the following folders:

**css** - contains main css file and potentially any other important css files if needed  
**html** - contains most pages for the website that do not need php  
**images** - image files will be here which will be referenced by the html pages  
**php** - main php file for one of the webpages. It is the php action script for input/validation  
**sql** - contains the database file in which the php page above would input into from users
