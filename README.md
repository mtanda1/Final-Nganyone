We are developing an end-to-end website for the Information Science Society. 
:star:

## Repo contains the following folders:

**css** - contains main css file and potentially any other important css files if needed \s
**html** - contains most pages for the website that do not need php \s
**images** - image files will be here which will be referenced by the html pages \s
**php** - main php file for one of the webpages. It is the php action script for input/validation \s
**sql** - contains the database file in which the php page above would input into from users \s
